----------------------------------------------- Data Summary ---------------------------------------------------------
This dataset contains 20 subjects that are recorded doing various activity. Each subject was recorded using
2 accelerometers and 1 gyroscope. There are 6 activities that are described in this dataset , which are :

1. Walking activity
2. Walking up the stairs activity
3. Walking down the stairs activity
4. Sitting activity
5. Standing activity
